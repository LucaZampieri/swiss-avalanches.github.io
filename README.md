We added this README after the misunderstanding about what we had to submit.

Our main result is the [website](https://swiss-avalanches.github.io) coded in JS and D3.js. You can find the notebooks that back our datastory [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/swiss-avalanches/swiss-avalanches.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/data_story.ipynb) and the maps extraction [there](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/swiss-avalanches/swiss-avalanches.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/run_through_map_extraction.ipynb).

We mostly worked together, the following break down is more or less informative.

| Name          | Main task          |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Brune         | Maps extraction    |
| Jean-Baptiste | Data visualisation |
| Arnaud        | Data story         |

We will work together on the final presentation, Brune will present it.
