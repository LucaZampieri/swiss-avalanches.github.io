#### Piz Vilan, GR, Switzerland: Avalanche kills 5 tourists

![image](../img/images_data_story/avalanche.png)

**Eight** people were swept backcountry touring in an avalanche in Switzerland. **Five** of them did not survive. The announced **danger level** was 3. The death toll on that day was the worst in five years. 

Up to 1.2 metres of snow has fallen in the region in recent days, and authorities had made repeated warnings of continuing avalanche dangers in many parts of the Swiss Alps and the Jura Mountains.

This avalanche went down a mountain's eastern flank at an elevation of 2340 meters. The group of skiers caught was **backcountry touring**. 

There was no immediate word on what triggered the avalanche. 

- *What is the evolution of such accidents over time?*
- *Is the exposure of the location of the accident a main cause?*
- *Are some mountain activities riskier than others?*

We will try to answer these questions through an interaction of collected data.

One can notice from the previous facts that the group caught was backcountry touring, but one does know that accidents can also happen off-piste skiing. Moreover, the higher the danger level is, the higher are the odds of being swept by an avalanche. 

*ici on met les deux plots, killed par danger level correspondant au off-piste skiing et backcountry touring*

OU ALORS:

One can notice from the previous facts that the group caught was skiing at a level 3 of danger. Moreover, the higher the danger level is, the higher are the odds of being swept by an avalanche. Which mountain activity is the most blabla

*ici on met les deux plots, killed par active correspondant a differents danger levels*

OU LES DEUX?

Tiens si on faisait une etude sur plusieurs ann√©es?
